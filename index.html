                        <p>
                            I felt insecure about my body image for a very long time. I hated looking at myself in photographs because I only focused on my imperfections. The lack of confidence in my physical appearance made my social anxiety even worse. This affected my relationships with people and my mental health. I was fixated on other people's perception of me and as a result, I was not contempt with being myself. I believe that the first step to loving yourself is to accept all of your imperfections, let go of things that are not under your control and to work on everything that you can change in order to become the best version of yourself. Here I want to share five things that have improved my body image and helped me gain confidence in myself.

                        <p>I have suffered from bad acne ever since puberty so I tried to adopt a proper skincare routine for myself and since then I have tried many products and home remedies to try and improve my skin. These are the products that I am currently using which have helped clear my skin and improve its texture. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly first.</p>

                        <p>
                            I started noticing some significant signs of hair loss around my 20s and I realised my hair was thinning out. My hair felt brittle to touch and it got very greasy after 1-2 days of not shampooing. So I booked a consultaion with <a href="https://www.belgraviacentre.com/" target="_blank">Belgravia Centre</a> and started taking the following medication and built a hair care routine to prevent further damage and try to recover what I lost. My hair has become fuller and healthier as a result of using these.

                        <img src="img/Healthy-Food-Diet-PNG-Clipart.png" alt="diet plan" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"/>
                        <p>
                            After starting university and living on my own, I had to learn how to cook by myself. Therefore I needed a diet which not only gives me all the essential nutrients but also helps build muscle and achieve my health and fitness goals. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A high protein intake is crucial for muscle growth and repair. I eat three to six eggs everyday, usually by making an omelette. I alternate between chicken and beef recipes and in my experience I have found it easy to meal prep by cooking a large pot of fried rice with vegetables(carrots, broccoli, peppers) and chicken breast cut into mini fillets. I like to get beef mince because it is the most convenient, and cook a large pot of Japanese curry with rice which is super simple and only requires a few ingredients like onion, carrots, potato, curry powder and beef mince.                         
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is also important to incorporate fruits and vegetables into your diet so I eat a fruit salad with greek yogurt. And for vegetables I usually stir fry spinach or broccoli. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As a university student with a busy schedule, I think this is a simple meal plean which is very nutritious and healthy but also relatively low-effort. 
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="exercise">4. <u>Exercise</u></h3>

                        <p>
                            I had always been fairly skinny. I found it very hard to gain weight due to my high metabolism. So getting into the gym has been pivotal in my journey of self improvement. I lift weights and follow an upper-lower training split into five days with 2 days of rest. This has helped me gain muscle, make my frame look bigger, increase my strength and endurance, helped me achieve a more defined physique and improved my self-confidence significantly. 
                        </p>

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Sleep - It is extremely important to get at least 8 hours of sleep everyday. It gets rid of eye bags, and tiredness. It also helps prevent acne and maintain good skin and hair health. You will look and feel more energetic while avoiding a myriad of health problems.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Eat a clean and balanced diet - This supports healthy weight management and boosts the immunse system. Promotes healthy skin, hair and nails.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Exercise - Improve both physical and mental health. It is important to do some form of cardio regularly to strengthens the heart and improves circulation, reducing the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Grooming and hygiene - Maintain good hygiene which helps you look your best and makes people feel more comfortable around you when you look clean and smell good.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Reduce screen time - Prolonged screen use can lead to poor posture, increases stress and anxiety, and reduce your attention span. By reducing your screen time you can prevent these problems, and also create healthier habits instead like going out for a walk, journaling or reading books which encourages mindfulness.
